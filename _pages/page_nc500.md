... or: how to spend 11 days in Scotland on a motorcycle.

## Introduction

I got my drivers license for riding a motor cycle in 2018, bought a Triumph Street Twin and did a small tour in Saxony with one of my best friends. It was a nice experience and so we planned on doing a longer trip. We decided to give Scotland a third try. We have been there two times, every time by car and liked it a lot. So why not try it on two motorcycles.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/nc500/whole-trip.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Our trip on the island." %}

## Prologue

We initially planned on starting in the town we both grew up. That did not work out. I packed my bike, jumped on it and turned the ignition. Nothing happened. Nothing. I stood there and did not know what to do. Played around with the cables but without any success. Fortunately [Sören](https://www.expedition-europe.de) was in his garage working on this bike. He checked my battery and said it was dead. I told him about the trip and he instantly gave me a battery to check if it was just the battery or something more severe. The bike started. I was relieved. I tried to call my dealer to arrange for a emergency check the next morning (Saturday). I reached the junior manager Luca of [Triumph Oberfranken](https://triumph-oberfranken.de/de) who told me to bring the bike in. I told him what I planned on doing the next 14 days and he assured me to have the bike ready to go the next morning. After a wakeful night I drove to the garage to find a mechanic working on the bike. He said the bike is good to go. So I went on, headed towards Schwabhausen only to have the engine light coming up after 20 miles. Left the highway to call the garage. The mechanic told me to come back so that he can have another look. I sat there beside the guy and we could not make out the problem. I asked him what he would do if he was in my shoes: take the risk and ride or stay home and have the bike fixed. It was an easy decision for him: take the trip and ignore the light because the engine was running fine, the bike is almost brand new and he rather be towed than not have tried to make the trip...

## Schwabhausen - Hünxe

-   [Route](https://kurv.gr/uBT8g) @ kurviger.de (348km)

I gave Alex a call as soon as I left. We met in Schwabhausen around 1:30 pm. We paired the intercoms, got some gas and got on the highway towards IJmuiden. After approximately 5 hours or so we decided to look for a place for the night. Our first day ended at the highway hotel Hünxe Ost.

We got a snack and went to bed.

## Hünxe - Ijmuiden

-   [Route](https://kurv.gr/5aEs3) @ kurviger.de (216km)

We started quite early, drove to a nearby town and stopped at a bakery for breakfast. Then we continued towards Amsterdam. The second stop was at a McDonalds in Noord-Holland around noon. Knowing that the ferry will leave the port at 6 pm we had plenty of time. We decided to drive past the ferry terminals and have a look at the sea. We took a walk at the beach on the Noordpier (where Alex lost his shoe sole) and stopped at a nearby grocery store on our way back to the terminal.

We got into the ferry queue around 4 pm with other motorcyclists and a bunch of cars. An hour or so later we had put our luggage into the cabin and started walking around the deck to kill time. The sea was meant to be calm but it wasn't. The subtle rocking was challenging but bearable. The cars below deck did not take it well: their alarm systems kept going off in the middle of the night.

## Newcastle upon Tyne - Crianlarich (1/11)

-   [Route](https://kurv.gr/5eLCT) @ kurviger.de (334km)

We went below deck to unstrap the bikes at around 10 am. The unloading procedure took around 45 minutes. The time on the ferry is approximately 17 hours (5 pm to 11 am (+1)). After we left the ferry we had to go through immigration which may took another 15 minutes or so.

As we were still not on the NC500 we decided to get there as fast a possible which meant taking the motorway. First stop was in Adderstone at a petrol station. From there we went to [Edinburgh Triumph](https://www.edinburghtriumph.co.uk) go get some thread lock and an allen key. My mirrors got loose and though we fixed it with tape I wanted to be prepared to fix it properly if the problems occurs again. Alex took the chance to buy new shoes and I got myself a baselayer.

The sun was shining when we left the city but soon found ourselves in rain. We did not immediately put on the appropriate clothes and when we did so it was to late - we were already quite wet. We checked the prices of nearby hotels but had to go for the Best Western in Crianlarich. I don't know the rate but I remember it being above our limit. Anyway it was nice having a cup of tea and a warm shower. We ate in the attached pub and drank beer we still had from the grocery store in Ijmuiden.

## Crianlarich - Strathcarron (2/11)

We had the first proper english breakfast and headed towards the NC500. The streets were still wet and it also continued to rain. I kept the rain cover on my tailbag. We did not take the road right next to Loch Ness but instead took a small road east of it which offered a beautiful scenery. We stopped at Harry Gow on the A9 near North Kessock. The sun came out but was soon disturbed by more rain. Our second day ended in the Lochcarron Hotel. The sun came out again and motivated us to have little walk. We had a burger and an ale for dinner.

## Strathcarron - Ullapool (3/11)

-   [Route](https://kurv.gr/4DYNu) @ kurviger.de (180km)

We had a good english breakfast and where accompanied by a black lab. <Bild> The streets were dry and we were eager to get to Ullapool. As we got more into the rural areas we experienced less traffic and could enjoy the narrow roads. It was overcast so we continously watched our for oncoming rain. Our first stop was in Kinlochewe at the Service Station. We made another stop at Loch Maree around noon but continued quickly towards Ullapool. We stayed at The Royal Hotel - Ullapool because it was the only place that had some rooms left. We dropped our stuff and walked around the small town. We made up for the high rate at the hotel by getting our diner the Tesco Superstore.

## Ullapool - Tongue (4/11)

-   [Route](https://kurv.gr/KXymK) @ kurviger.de (199km)

As the previous day ended with rain we hoped that it would be dry the next morning. Which it was. There was light drizzle but as soon as we got near Chlachtoll the sun came out. Gosh it was fantastic. Chlachtoll at the Bay of Stoer looked beautiful as did the Stoer Head. Driving was very nice too: no traffic at all, narrow windy roads, no rain, sun. A perfect day. It was on this day when we started making coffee breaks. We stopped at The Secret Garden Tea in Drumbeg and sat in the sun drinking coffee and having a cake. We continued and made another stop at Sango Bay. I would never have imagined finding such a beautiful beach in Scotland. The weather allowed us to drive another hour or two. After an hour or so we stopped in Tongue and got a room in the [Tigh-Nan-Ubal Guesthouse](https://www.tigh-nan-ubhal.co.uk). We parked the bikes in the yard and went for dinner in the [Ben Loyal Hotel](https://www.benloyal.co.uk). Food was good as was the Puffin Ale.

## Tongue - Wick (5/11)

-   [Route](https://kurv.gr/qCvvr) @ kurviger.de (147km)

We started straight towards John O'Groats but stopped in Thurso for ... coffee and cake. [Caffee Cardosi](https://www.facebook.com/CafeCardosi/) is a nice place located on the main road in Thurso. We spent an hour or more there because there was light rain outside. We drove to [Dunnet Head Lighthouse](https://dunnetheadlighthouse.com) but quickly continued to John O' Groats where we stopped at another lighthouse: the [Duncansby Head Lighthouse](https://www.nlb.org.uk/lighthouses/duncansby-head/).

As soon as we entered the greater Wick area we stopped, checked booking.com and booked a night in the [Nethercliffe Hotel](http://www.nethercliffehotel.co.uk). There was not much to explore so we quickly ended up having diner at [De Vita's Pizzeria & Cafe Bar](https://www.facebook.com/DeVitas-Pizzeria-Cafe-Bar-249378068464033/). First time we were told that we are lucky because usually you don't get a table without a reservation. Pizza was ok. Atmosphere was mediocre.

## Wick - Contin (6/11)

-   [Route](https://kurv.gr/7WrJk) @ kurviger.de (239km)

We left wick and followed the A99 southwards and stopped near Whaligoe to check out the [Whaligoe steps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whaligoe). Parking was limited and as we wondered were to park a resident started talking to us and invited us in. We checked the stairs first (quite impressive) and got our own little history lesson when the guy waited for us literally right next to our bikes.

We continued on the A99 and stopped in Tain for coffee and cake. We did not take the direct way to Contin but instead drove around on the [Black Isle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Isle). Booking the accomodation in Contin was easy - finding it wasn't. The place sounded like a hostel but was actually an Airbnb in the middle of a residential complex. We were welcomed but soon left on our own. We drove to Strathpeffer and had a great diner at [The Deli in the Square](https://www.facebook.com/Deli-in-the-square-316241311890894/)

## Contin - Dunkeld (7/11)

-   [Route](https://kurv.gr/tNCta) @ kurviger.de (275km)

As we finished the NC500 and almost drove a circle we decided to spend the rest of our days in Scotland in the southeast part of the Highlands. We drove through the Cairngorms National Park and made a "rain break" in Aviemore at a [Costa Coffee](https://www.costa.co.uk/locations/store-locator/map#latitude=57.19448999999999&longitude=-3.823812). It was quite busy despite the rain. The weather did not get better and we were quite soaked when we finally arrived in the [Royal Dunkeld Hotel](https://royaldunkeld.co.uk) in Dunkeld. We hang our clothes to dry and went into the hotel to eat something.

## Dunkeld - Lumphanan (8/11)

-   [Route](https://kurv.gr/bT4nn) @ kurviger.de (247km)

There is not much to report. Weather was very good. We drove to Grantown-on-Spey where we had our coffee and cake fix at [Maclean's Highland Bakery](https://www.macleansbakery.com/shops/macleans-shops/). There were some guys in lycra and I just thought they must be crazy driving through the highlands. Our day ended in Lumphanan. We stayed at the [Macbeth Arms](https://www.macbeth-arms.co.uk). We were the only guests and had to call in to get in. The place did not look like much but the room was perfect. The locals came as soon as the pub opened and we enjoyed an ale and something to eat.

## Lumphanan - Montrose (9/11)

-   [Route](https://kurv.gr/dBQK2) @ kurviger.de (129km)

The breakfast was just some candy bars and an orange juice. We drove straight to the coast (Stonehaven) and had coffee at [Shamrock and Thistle](https://www.facebook.com/shamrockandthistlecoffee/). While we sat there we checked if there were distilleries on our way and decided to drive by the [Fettercairn Distillery](https://www.fettercairnwhisky.com/en/). We did a tour, got some samples and I even bought a bottle :). We drove another hour and checked in at the [Star Hotel](https://www.starhotelmontrose.com) in Montrose. After a short break we left the hotel and went to [Sharkys](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186496-d5457202-Reviews-Sharkys-Montrose_Angus_Scotland.html) for dinner. Food was very good as was the service and the atmosphere. We finished the day with a digestive walk to the beach.

## Montrose - Haddington (10/11)

-   [Route](https://kurv.gr/3z9aW) @ kurviger.de (221km)

We decided to stay as close to the coast as possible on our way down south and did not take the A92 from Dundee to Edinburgh. Anyway as we drove through Edinburgh we stopped at [Edinburgh Triumph](<https://www.edinburghtriumph.co.uk>) and I got the baselayer replaced (it had some holes in it which I saw a day after I bought it). They didnt argue and replaced it immediately. To keep the drive on the next day short we drove little further south and stayed in [The Golf Tavern](https://www.golftavernhaddington.co.uk) in Haddington. I wanted to put a few drinks away but Alex wasn't up for it. So I just had two Belhaven Best and prepared myself mentally for the next day and the ferry.

## Haddington - Newcastle upon Tyne (11/11)

-   [Route](https://kurv.gr/FxM8p) @ kurviger.de (182km)

We left Haddington around 10 am and drove straight to Newcastle upon Tyne. We stopped at a grocery store in North Shields and bought some food (tiger buns, bananas, nuts).  We entered queue around 3 pm and started  leaving the dock around 5. We tried to kill some time but ended up in our room around 8 pm.

## Ijmuiden - home

-   Route (636km)

The night was bad. Alex did not sleep well and I woke up every now and then due to the subtle movement. Overall not the best start into the final day of driving. We left the ferry and got on the motorway. The weather in Scotland was - except for the rain - very good for driving. The weather in Amsterdam was good at first but became challenging. It was way too hot while driving. It was even worse when we were faced with traffic jams. We lost our communication after some hours and just tried to drive as much as possible. It was around 4 pm when we decided not to stop but to pull through and drive home.

Our ways parted where we met: Schwabhausen. We put in some gas, I drank an energy drink and then we both continued driving home.

The day ended at 9 pm with 636km on the odometer.
