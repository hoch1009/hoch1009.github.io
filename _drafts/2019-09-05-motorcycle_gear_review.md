# Gear Review

Even before you start making your drivers license you need to buy gear. I tried to start cheap which turned out to be quite expensive. I continuously replaced almost everything. As my first big motorcycle trip came closer I had to invest some more and would now say that I do have everything I need and I wont be buying anything else because not its perfect. For now. This post is meant to shed some light on different products from a every day normal guy.

## SHOEI EX-Zero

Had a Jethelm which was to loud and to prone to catch wind and got myself the EX-Zero right after it had been released. Was very pleased with it and after some time it became very comfortable.


## 100% Barstow Deus

Saw a promo video with Stefan Lantschner and asked him which goggle he wore. Bought the same and was very happy. The tint is not to dark, it just fits and reduces the wind and noise – at least a little. Unfortunately the lens cracked at several places all of which are where you fix the lens to the frame.

## ICON SuperDuty 5

I had some high boots that where quite uncomfortable and decided to go for something lower. I found the Icon SuperDuty 5 and bought them. Delivery took a while but they finally arrived and made a good first impression.

The good:
• good looks
• comfortable for all day riding
• sturdy
• price

The not so good:
• water ingress through show tongue (top)
• quite warm in summer
• little grip

## Cardo Freecom 4+

Have not had an intercom and was looking for something to talk to my mate while driving. I was a little skeptic about the interoperability with third party intercoms but it worked like a charm and the battery life was great. So was the sound quality.

The good:
• compatible with third party intercoms (at least FreedCom)
• sound quality
• battery life
• water resistant

The not so good
• price
• app not working properly (cannot turn of music once turned on - only force-closing the app works)

## KNOX Kenton jacket

Right before our trip to Scotland I bought the Kenton jacket as a main jacket and because I had no other that was waterresistent. The quality of the jacket is great and the details are superb. You have two zippers (left and right) which enable you to expand the jacket if you wear something under it. You can unzip it starting from you wrist and only expand the arms. You can also unzip it from the bottom, stop under your arms and therefore just expand the main part of the jacket. Or just zip “right through”. Compared to other jackets the Kenton restricts you in your movement as soon as you wear protective gear under it. Other jackets have had some kind of recess in the back at the height of the shoulder which allows you to move your arms forward without pulling back the sleeves. This is especially the case when wearing the Kenton in combination with the armoured shirt and the Windbuddy. The Kenton jackets continuously slides up and allows wind to stream in.

The good:
• Built quality and details.
• Waterproof

The not so good:
• Restricted movement when worn in combination with other parts of the KNOX layering system.


## KNOX Windbuddy

I quickly realized that I needed something that protects me from wind. Fortunately KNOX had a solution for it which I bought. I really struggled with the size. All KNOX products are meant to work in combination by sticking to your size (in my case M). The Windbuddy itself fits very well but with the armoured shirt below it tends to slide upwards – especially in the back. As the material is quite flexible your feel a little bit “squeezed” in but your movement is not restricted.

The good:
• Protects you from wind and light rain.
• Keeps you warm.
• Very casual looking jacket that you can wear after your ride (I just put the armoured shirt down, put the windbuddy back on and went straight to the bars/pubs).

The not so good:
• Material quality: the stretch on the back ruptured.


## KNOX Armoured shirt

I had three motorcycle jackets with protector before I bought the armoured shirt. Sold all three and sticked with the shirt from Knox. It fits well and allows me to wear almost everything (sweater, flannel shirts etc.) on the bike with proper impact protection.

The good:
• The (tight) fit is great.
• Mesh material provides ventilation.
• Protection.

The not so good:
• The sleeves are a little too long.
• Its longer than the other Knox products. When you wear it in combination with them the armoured shirts is always the longest items and can be seen.


## Legend Gear Tail bag



## Legend Gear Tank bag (magnetic)

Right after I bought my motorcycle I was looking for a bag that did not require any fixtures. I wanted something “plug and play” and found the magnetic tank bag over at SW-Motech. I liked the look and the fact that you don’t see it (or any mounting accessoires) when it is not on the bike. You get it with a transparent pad that should help you to avoid scratches. I did not use it and I don’t think that it is necessary if you clean the bottom of the bag before attaching it. Tony Walters (@viewfromthemancave) put three cans in it. I used it for storing gloves, granola bars, ear protection and almost everything I might need on a ride.

The good:
• keeps all your small items in place
• stays in place even at highway speeds
• looks good

The not so good:
• it’s a little hassle to carry it around when off the bike
