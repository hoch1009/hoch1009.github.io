Some words on SAP<LINK> and the „missing transactions“: we could have achieved the same by using some transactions multiple times with varying selection parameters and copying this information together in one file. 
The reason I decided to got with only 1 transaction and some formulars was that the potential for human error (eventhough only I did make those reports) was relatively small:
- one transaction – minimal selections
- one file copying process
- one excel file

Going the other way meant: 
1) defining selection parameters 
2) defining a work (copying) sequence 
3) copying multiple files as worksheets into another file. 

... It seemed tedious and it lacked the aspect of being a challenge.


There were other ways back then and I think there are other ways now with Business Intelligence (SAP BI<LINK>) and such being part of SAP ERP.
