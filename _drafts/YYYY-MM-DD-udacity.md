I tend to pursue different interests that are more or less related to my line of work. After I spend some six months in 2016 at the Georg-Simon-Ohm university where I pursued a certificate for purchase controlling I decided to have deeper look into data analysis. A rather short review of the available courses revealed that the Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity seemed to be the best fit for me. It was interactive, somehow supported by renowned companies and it was quite affordable compared to a university course/certificate/degree.
