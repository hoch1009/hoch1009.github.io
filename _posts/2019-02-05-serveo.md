I used [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to expose a Python server that I use with the sipgate.io api. The free version of ngrok provides a individual url. Every time my internet connection gets interrupted ngrok provides a new url I then manually need to forward to sipgate. In almost every case I noticed that the url changed when the server did not work as expected.

Some months ago I found [serveo](http://serveo.net) which is an identically service with two major advantages:

- you can have an url that persists
- works out of the box

The service from [Trevor Dixon](https://twitter.com/trevordixon) allows you to request an alias that you can use. Depending on your alias you can claim it even after a disconnect. Combined with [autossh](https://www.everythingcli.org/ssh-tunnelling-for-fun-and-profit-autossh/) you can keep the ssh connection for as long as you want and prevent someone from grabbing your alias

> Autossh is a program to start a copy of ssh and monitor it, restarting it as necessary should it die or stop passing traffic.

While you need a binary for ngrok the only thing you need for serveo is an ssh-client:

~~~
ssh -R 80:localhost:3000 serveo.net
~~~

The above command makes your service running on port 3000 available to the public. You need to check the output of this command to get the url.

~~~
ssh -R myfancysubdomain:80:localhost:3000 serveo.net
~~~

Running this command provides your service at http://myfancysubdomain.serveo.net. There are a lot more options - like requesting multiple tunnels - described in the [manual](http://serveo.net/#manual).
