Some weeks ago a [local tragel agency](http://www.frankenland-reisen.de/) offered a weekend trip to Prague which we could not resist.

The trip started on Saturday 6:15 a. m. at a local bus station. We took our place and the bus started driving. We picked up other passengers along the way and headed to Prague on the A6/E50.
Some stops (coffee breaks and such) later we arrived in Prague. The first stop was in district 5 where we picked up the local guide (Kristina). She spoke very good german and had a nice sense of humor.
The bus drove to the [Čechův most](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svatopluk_Čech_Bridge) where we were dropped off. The rest of the group went to the city with Kristina but we decided to enjoy the city on our own.

We had three hours and would spend those in the following way (we did otherwise):

Stay on this side of the Moldova, walk past the government buildings and head to [Malostranské náměstí](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malostranské_náměst%C3%AD) where you can grab a [coffee](http://en.starbuckscoffee.cz) or buy some souvenirs. You can also stop by the [Franz Kafka museum](http://www.kafkamuseum.cz/ShowPage.aspx?tabId=-1) if you want to.
Next stop should be the [Charles bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bridge) - expect it to be very crowded - every time you are there. If you passed the bridge continue straight and head to the famous [Old Town Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Town_Square).
Take a look at everything around. You can even spend some time on the christmas market but I'd recommend to put that off.
If you want to go shopping (which we wanted) you need to take another walk towards [Náměstí Republiky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Náměst%C3%AD_Republiky,_Prague) where you can find the [Palladium](https://www.palladiumpraha.cz). There is also a [Billa](https://www.billa.cz/) neabry if you are looking for czech wafer and tea.
As the three hours will come to an end you should walk back. Through the city or along the moldova.

We arrived at the [Čechův most](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svatopluk_Čech_Bridge), took our seats in the bus and drove to the [hotel](http://www.hotelduo.cz/default-en.html). We checked in, drank something and relaxed a little.
The day was not over yet. We decided to take a boat cruise on the moldova. The bus took us back to the city, dropped us off at the chechuv most and we walked to the other side of the moldova and got on a boat.
We sat at a table with another family. It was so cramped you had to plan to stand up and to return to the table in the right (sitting) order. Otherwise no one would have had time to enjoy their dinner.
You could not move your seat backwards because there was another passenger. Another downside was that we spend almost 45 out of those 120 minutes in watergates.

We left the boat 2 hours later, returned to the bus and drove back to the hotel.

The next day started with a breakfast with appr. 100 other hotel guests. We went to the bus after checkin out and drove to the city one last time.
We were given another 3 hours to see the christmas market at the [Old Town Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Town_Square) which we did. We also stopped at the [Hard Rock Cafe](http://www.hardrock.com/cafes/prague/) and went to the Palladium again (in front was another small market).

We left prague almost 24 hours after we arrived. It was a good trip worth the money - especially if you already know the city and just want a quick trip.
But I would not go another time - at least not with a bus full of people roughly 30 to 40 years older than me.

Most of them tended to nag at everything and almost everyone was disrespectful.
I treat people with respect (hold the door open, let somebody go first etc.) but they were all just selfish as if someone was trying to steal from them.
This is not a rant against old people - its a rant against all people lacking the basics of respectful human co-existence.
