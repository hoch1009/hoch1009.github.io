As most people of my age I am also watching tv shows ([trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/users/chho)). Most of the time I do this while I am doing something else. There are tv shows which do require your full attentation and then there are shows that you can have running while you are busy doing something else (watching Criminal Minds while ironing, running some monotonous tasks in Excel while watching The Following etc.). You can follow the story without knowing the details. You may apply this to a lot of other shows but there is one new show where I constantly struggle to follow the plot because I am quite bad at focussing on the show only.

Manhunt: Unabomber tells the story of how the FBI caught [Ted Kaczynski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski). The story is interesting (because its based on a true story) and the acting is on point (the amitious linguistic forensics guy; the cop who doesn't give a sh** about profiles etc.; Ted Kaczynski himself as a psychological mastermind). Both things combined make up a very good show that I will not binge-watch but gradually on a weekly basis.
