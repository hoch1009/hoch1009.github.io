Some years ago I bought a [UPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply) from [APC](https://www.apc.com/). It is a small unit for my network equipment. About 3 or 4 weeks ago I got warned that the battery has to be replaced.

The unit I own (BX700U-GR) is one that is not user-servicable. A quick search showed that the only not so user-friendly thing is that you have to remove some screws. I ordered the replacement battery (APC RBC 110) at Amazon and received the package. Replaced the old one with the new and was happy having a reliable unit again. Unfortunately [NUT](https://networkupstools.org/documentation.html) did show a remaining time of 5 minutes and caused my Synology NAS to shutdown. I let the battery charge for hours, tried to calibrate it. I removed NUT and installed [apcupsd](http://www.apcupsd.org/) because I thought NUT might have an issue/incompatibility. Unfortunately this was not the case. Apcupsd showed the same runtime.

I ended up receiving a new battery and going through the same time consuming tests (check apcupsd, remove it, install NUT …). Until now I did not bother changing a battery date (in apcupsd) because I thought „what does the battery date have to do with the performance of the unit“. I did change it and voila: I have a runtime of over an hour (at a load of 10%). Anyway I will have to run a calibration to see if those values are correct. But at least the connected devices do not shutdown anymore.

## TL;DR:

If you do replace a battery in the APC UPS change the battery date (in the software). Otherwise it will not recognize the battery as new.
