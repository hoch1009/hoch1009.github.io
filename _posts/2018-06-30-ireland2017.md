We arrived in Dublin on October, 28th and headed straight to our B&B. We walked around the city and used the Hop On Hop Off bus on the first day. On day two we walked to the Paddywagon office on Lower Gardiner Street. There were not many people so we were wondering if the tour would even start. We would learn later on that they don't start with a full bus. Instead they pickup people along the route (who booked a tour that was part of our 6 day trip). Our driver was Freddy. It was a challenge having a serious conversation with him. Anyway, he was a funny guy and kept the bus entertained - thats probably what he is paid for. Unfortunately he had to take care of something private two days before our tour would be over so we got another driver: Tiernan. Also a nice guide who even made us jog up a hill to see a beautiful sunset on the most western point of (mainland) Ireland!  

I would recommend everyone to do the tour because you see quite a lot (Monasterboice, The Peace Wall, Belfast, Titanic Quarter, Dark Hedges, Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge, Giants Causeway, Galway, Cliffs of Moher ...) and you do not need to drive around yourself. Bus was comfy, accommodation was good, you had plenty of time at all stops.
