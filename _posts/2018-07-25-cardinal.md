I was browsing the tv shows section of the onboard entertainment system and looked specifically for tv shows for which there were more than one or two episodes available. Side note: I do not get why there are shows where you can only watch like one or two episodes. Who does that?

Anyway ... I found a show I had not heard of before: [Cardinal](https://www.ctv.ca/Cardinal).

It is a Canadian crime show about a police detective called Cardinal. The first season which I watched on the plane is about a missing native Canadian girl and Cardinals struggle to clear the case. Another aspect is the preconception that anything involving native Canadians is handled with a lower priority compared to cases that do not involve native Canadians. The show is located in the Algonquin Bay area which actually is the area around North Bay, Ontario.

Great show and I am looking forward to season 2.
