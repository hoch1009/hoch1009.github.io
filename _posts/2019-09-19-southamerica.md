My girlfriend has a rather long list of destinations she wants to see. Some of them are a little more challenging and it is hard for her to find a travel companion (I do not need/want to see all of them :)). South America never appealed to me so for a very long time I told her she can go there but I will not join her. I had a change of heart in May last year and told her that I would be on her side when she finally sets foot on the Easter Island. She was happy and I was too.

Weeks and months went by and she did all the planning. Occasionally we would talk about the trip. At the end it looked like this:

* Arrive in Lima and spend two days there.
* Take a bus from Lima to Arequipa.
* Take a bus from Arequipa to Cusco.
* Explore Cusco and go to Macchu Picchu.
* Take a bus from Cusco to La Paz.
* Spend little under 24 hours in La Paz and continue to Uyuni (with a stop in Puno) by bus.
* Spend a day at the Salar de Uyuni and continue by bus towards San Pedro de Atacama.
* Spend some days in San Pedro de Atacama, pickup a rental car and drive along the coast to Santiago.
* Spend little under a week at the Easter Island.
* Get back home.

Renting a car for the whole trip was no option so we decided to take busses. Traveling by bus in South America was the more affordable and more comfortable way - at least that is what we came up with during our research. Not having a car also forced us to use backpacks instead of trolleys which made us think twice about all the stuff we usually take with us on trips. We ended up with 17 and 12 kgs. About a week before our trip would start I dug a little deeper and found a bunch of horror stories about South America. This last minute research made the trip a little more challenging especially in the first days where I did not knew what I should expect.

In hindsight it was all wrong. We had an awesome time and nothing happened.

* We took the more expensive busses and cannot complain. They leave on time, are mostly comfortable and brought us safely from A to B.
* We did not fell victim to pickpocketing or other scams. We have not made one bad experience over the course of four weeks.
* Nobody smiles but everyone was helpful if asked.

### Our bus trips:

* Lima to Arequipa with [Cruz del Sur](https://www.cruzdelsur.com.pe) (17 hours, mostly overnight)
* Arequipa to Cusco with [Cruz del Sur](https://www.cruzdelsur.com.pe) (10 hours, overnight)
* Cusco to La Paz with [Peru Hop](https://www.peruhop.com) (24 hours; stop in Puno)
* La Paz to Uyuni with [Todo Turismo](https://www.todoturismosrl.com) (11 hours, overnight)
* Uyuni to San Pedro de Atacama with Cruz del Norte (12 hours, during the day)

As mentioned: all busses were very good. The last one from Uyuni to San Pedro de Atacama became uncomfortable and we got a little annoyed because we sat in enough busses. Anyway, we crossed the border and arrived safely in San Pedro de Atacama.

### Highlights

One might think that Macchu Picchu would be the highlight but to be honest: it wasn't. You cannot go there and explore the place by yourself. Your guide will get you through the site in about an hour. You will be dropped of at a point from where you cannot go back. Park rangers will stop you even if you try. On your way out you are hurried by the rangers to not stay anywhere for more than 5 minutes. Given the fact that its a little hussle to get there it was disappointing.

Driving to the Colca Canyon was way better. Or exploring Cusco. Or driving along the west coast towards Santiago. I will continue to remember those moments before I think about the fact that I was at Macchu Picchu.

And I will sure remember our days on the Easter Island. I wasn't very happy to be surrounded by water and not beeing able to "flee" but I enjoyed it there. The waves are gigantic and loud. The people are friendly and laidback. The food (especially the vegetarian options) was good. Being in a store with empty shelves was nice because you quickly realize that you do not need something specific and you learn to appreciate the luxury you find yourself in when you are back at home.

**As I said: it was awesome and I would recommend it to everyone**
