Instead of celebrating the first Sunday in Advent we made a trip to Manchester.

Started by boarding a Ryanair plane in Nuremberg on Friday, 30th of November and flying to Stanstead. Headed straight to a nearly hotel, slept a little and then took the train to Manchester. Schedule was a little tight but we made it. The journey was very nice. The weather was ... what we expected it to be: rainy. Which is also the reason why there aren't that many pictures.
In Manchester we just drove around the city with a hop on hop off bus, visited a Christmas market and just walked around the city. We wanted to have a large vegan breakfast on Sunday but did not took into consideration that the shop might be closed. Had some fast food instead ;) We headed to the Manchester airport, got on the plane after some waiting and were back in Germany after little over 48 hours.
